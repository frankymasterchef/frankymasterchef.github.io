                    Step:"1. In a large, deep skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. - 2 Pour in tomatoes and use a wooden spoon to break tomatoes into chunks. Fill tomato can almost halfway with water and swirl to catch any remaining sauce, then add to skillet. Season with oregano, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper and stir in basil. Bring mixture to simmer. - 3.Reduce heat to low and simmer until liquid has reduced slightly, about 20 minutes. Discard basil before serving.",
                    Ingredients:"1/4 c. extra virgin olive oil - 1/2 medium onion, minced - 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced - 1 (28oz.) can whole tomatoes - 1 tsp. dried oregano - Pinch red pepper flakes - Kosher salt - Freshly ground black pepper - 2 large sprigs fresh basil",
                    Tips:"Use whole tomatoes. We like using (canned) whole tomatoes, and breaking them as they cook, for a chunkier marinara. If you prefer a smoother sauce, use a can of crushed tomatoes instead. This tastes amazing over a bowl of pasta, but it's also great for shakshuka, lasagna, and chicken parm. - Use San Marzano tomatoes. Trust, us. It actually makes a difference. We taste tested a bunch of popular super market brands and found out that San Marzano were sweeter and had a cleaner tomato taste. Luckily for you, they're easy to find at most grocery stores these days. - Simmering the sauce for forever is unnecessary. It doesn't need to simmer for hours and hours because it shouldn't taste super rich and complex. People love marinara sauce for it's bright flavor. - Add some water. If you just used the tomatoes from the can, your sauce will bubble and splash aggressively. Fill up your tomato can with a bit of water, swirl it around (to catch any clinging leftover tomato bits and juices), then add it to your skillet. This will loosen the tomato mixture to be more sauce like. - You don't need sugar. Some pasta sauces tell you to add a bit of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. But when you build the flavors (with EVOO, onion, garlic, basil, and red pepper flakes) and give it time to simmer (20 minutes) we don't think it's necessary. Flavor it with basil. Basil is a fragrant herb that is made for marinara. Instead of waiting to garnish your pasta with it, use it while the sauce is simmering. It'll infuse a ton of fresh flavor.",

                      Step:"1. Grease a large bowl with cooking spray. In a small bowl add water and sugar and stir to dissolve, then sprinkle over yeast and let sit until frothy, about 8 minutes. - 2. In another large bowl, add flour, salt, and oil. Pour in yeast mixture, then mix with a wooden spoon until everything is combined and a shaggy dough begins to form. Knead against sides of bowl until dough starts to come together, then turn onto your work surface and knead, adding a pinch of flour if needed, until it feels elastic and only slightly tacky, 5 minutes. Form into a tight ball, place into prepared bowl, and cover with a clean dish towel. Let rise in a warm spot in your kitchen until doubled in size, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. - 3. Gently punch down dough, then divide in 2, and roll into balls. At this point, you can freeze one, or make two pizzas. Let dough balls rest as you preheat oven to 500° and grease a large baking sheet with olive oil. Sprinkle all over with 2 tablespoons cornmeal. - 4. On your work surface, gently flatten one ball of dough and roll with a rolling pin (or stretch with your hands) until about 12” in diameter (as thin as you can). Carefully transfer to prepared baking sheet and brush dough all over with oil. Then, add your 1/2 cup sauce to middle of dough and spread outwards with a spoon or ladle, leaving about 1” for the crust. Top with half the slices of mozzarella. Bake until crust is golden and cheese is melty, about 15 minutes. - 5. Top with fresh basil leaves, a drizzle of olive oil, and red pepper flakes. - 6. Repeat with remaining dough and toppings for second pizza.",
                      Ingredients:"Cooking spray - 1 1/4 c. lukewarm water - 1 tbsp. granulated sugar - 1 (1/4oz.) packet active dry yeast (2¼ tsp.)  - 3 c. all purpose flour - 2 tsp. kosher salt - 1/4 c. extra virgin olive oil, as needed - 1/4 c. cornmeal, divided - 1 c. marinara, divided - 16 oz. fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced, divided - Fresh basil leaves - Pinch red pepper flakes",
                      Tips:"The way to go here is fresh, thinly sliced mozzarella. Sometimes it comes packed in water, so be sure to dry it off before slicing to avoid a watery pizza! If you've only got pre shredded mozz on hand, that'll work in a pinch. - Our pizza cooks at the very high temp of 500°. We're essentially trying to recreate a pizza oven, which can reach 1,000°, in a more realistic, at-home way. Because the dough is so thin, you really just want to crisp up the outside and keep it soft and chewy on the inside, versus baking it all the way through until it's cracker crisp. High temp is perfect for this. If your oven goes higher, feel free to crank the heat, just keep an eye on it! - Before you get started, stretch your dough and transfer it to a well-oiled baking sheet. We also love adding a thin layer of cornmeal for an extra crunchy crust, but feel free to skip if you're not into that. Word to the wise: add your toppings only once your dough has been transferred to the baking sheet (or pizza stone). If you top it and then try to move it, things tend to get messy and extremely frustrating.",

                        Tips:"When you put hot ingredients into a cold slow cooker, everything has to heat back up again, which can tack on an extra 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time. - With very few exceptions (shredded chicken and poaching are the two that comento mind), it’s always worth searing chicken in a hot skillet on the stovetop before you add it to the slow cooker. - Slow cooker chicken dinners are best reserved for weekend evenings, meal prep time, or when you can get an early jump on dinner.",
